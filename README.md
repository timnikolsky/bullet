**Bullet** is a productivity and note-taking app.

### Planned features

- **Cross-platform**. The app will be available on desktop and mobile and web.
- **Local-first**. You own your data, always have full access to it, and can use the app offline.
- **Private**. Supports local-only workspaces, encrypted online mode and protected pages.
- **Decentralized**. You can host your own server or use a third-party one, and you can also use the app completely offline.
- **Blocks system**. Every piece of content is a block, which is much easier to work with than a plain mardown.
- **Extensible**. You can install plugins into your workspace to have custom blocks, commands, and more.
- **Customizable**. You can personalize your workspace however you want, with color themes, custom fonts and custom CSS.
